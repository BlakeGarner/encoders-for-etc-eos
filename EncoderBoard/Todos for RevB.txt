* Enlarge button-top cut-outs on acrylic by 0.5mm - it's a bit too snug for the button travel.
* Add 10k pull-up resistors to the push-buttons (just like on the encoder buttons).
* Dividers between each status LED on the right side of the module.
* Wider footprint so the screw holes can be closer to the corners.
