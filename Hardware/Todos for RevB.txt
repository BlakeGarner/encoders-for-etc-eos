* Enlarge button-top cut-outs on acrylic by 0.5mm - it's a bit too snug for the button travel.
* Add 10k pull-up resistors to the push-buttons (just like on the encoder buttons).
* Dividers between each status LED on the right side of the module.
* Wider footprint so the screw holes can be closer to the corners.
* Frosted top panel for the RGB LEDs - to scatter the light in brighter environments.
* Allow a bit more tolerance in the acrylic cutouts - in the x axis measurements seemed to drift by as much as 0.5mm.
* Consider an alternative to the 74HCT245 (either MOSFET design or single channel design)
* Round off the corners of the PCB and acrylic
* Overhang the etching of layer 3 a bit (or split into a 3mm + 1.5mm piece?
* Replace the switches with something more common on Digikey/Mouser. (Maybe the FSMIJ62Bx04? or FSMIJM62Bx04?)
