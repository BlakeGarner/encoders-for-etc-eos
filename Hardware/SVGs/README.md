# Encoders for ETC Eos Hardware - Encoder Board Drawings

This folder contains all the `svg` drawings for the acrylic case.
The initial layout was exported from extra layers in the KiCAD model, and then colours/line-widths adjusted to match that required by my local laser-cutter supplier.

If using these files to get your own case printed, check the file requirements of your laser-cutter supplier with what is used here. The colours, line-widths or file-format may need to be adjusted.

See below for descriptions of each file:

__EncoderBoard-brd.svg__,\
__EncoderBoard-Cmts_Usr.svg__,\
__EncoderBoard-Dwgs_User.svg__,\
__EncoderBoard-Eco1_User.svg__,\
__EncoderBoard-Eco2_User.svg__,\
__EncoderBoard-Margin.svg__:\
These are direct exports from the initial cut-out lines drawn in KiCAD PCB (the initial drawing was done in KiCAD on unused layers as it was the easiest way to line up with all the components).

__01_EncoderBoard-2mm-Black-Bottom.svg__,\
__02_EncoderBoard-4.5mm-Black-UnderLayer.svg__,\
__03_EncoderBoard-4.5mm-Black-MidLayer.svg__,\
__04_EncoderBoard-2mm-UpperLayer.svg__,\
__05_EncoderBoard-3mm-TransBlack-Upper.svg__:\
These lay out each layer on a separate drawing.

__EncoderBoard_2.0mm_Black_Gloss_Acrylic.svg__,\
__EncoderBoard_3.0mm_Transparent_Black_Acrylic.svg__,\
__EncoderBoard_4.5mm_Black_Gloss_Acrylic.svg__:\
These combine layers using the same acrylic material/thickness on a single drawing.

__EncoderBoard_2.0mm_Black_Gloss_Acrylic.JPG__,\
__EncoderBoard_3.0mm_Transparent_Black_Acrylic.JPG__,\
__EncoderBoard_4.5mm_Black_Gloss_Acrylic.JPG__:\
These are renderings of the above three drawings and are informative only.
